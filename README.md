This code will take in a pulsar paramter file (.par) and create a mass-mass diagram for the pulsar and its binary companion based on the predicted values of the post Keplerian parameters by GR.

The code is called by running: python mass.py parfile.par

The par file will need the specific parameters to create the graph

Extra files in here are test pulsar data

Here is an example of what the Output will look like image
